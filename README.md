## Hi there, I'm Puu

### Intro

I'm a kood/Jõhvi coding school/academy student who is passionate about coding. I already started coding as a teenager and ever since it has been interesting to me.
I'm currently still learning JavaScript, soon TypeScript, and aspire to become good at those languages.
I'm a supporter of open-source and Linux and always include the according License in my projects.
